Add the export keyword before the function name so it is available to other modules.


To import a single export from a module:
import { <component name> } from '<module name>'

To rename an import, use the as keyword:
import { <component name> as <new name> } from '<module name>'

To import the entire module into a single variable, and use it to access the module exports:
import * as <variable name> from '<module name>'


In JavaScript, you use external libraries in your code by using the requires statement. 
In TypeScript, you gain access to them by using the import statement. 
After importing a library and its type definition, you can use it in your code and gain the benefits of 
Intellisense and type checking.
